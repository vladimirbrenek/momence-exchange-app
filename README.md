3. Add a simple form, into which the customer can enter an amount in CZK and select a currency, and after submitting (clicking a button or in real-time) sees the amount entered in CZK converted into the selected currency.

4. Commit your code throughout your work and upload the resulting codebase into a Github repo.

5. Deploy the app so it can be viewed online (it doesnâ€™t matter where - e.q. Vercel, Netflify, etc.).
6. Add automated tests which might be appropriate to ensure that your solution is working correctly.

7. Tech stack: React (+ Hooks), TypeScript, Styled Components, React Query.

Overall: Keep the code simple and the UI nice and easy to use for the user.
